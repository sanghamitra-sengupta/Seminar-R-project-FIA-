# Seminar-R-project-FIA
USE THE tree_raw_data_with_env_cleaned.csv
Conduct EDA
Calculate species richness (sr) at grid level #lat long, species name, SR
Calculate the average sr aggregated at the latitudinal band #using x from grid level have LAT BAND, SPECIES, SR. average sr per band
Calculate the moving average at 0.5 degree interval
Estimate the SR using bootstrapping methods (1000 times simulation,200 per simulation) and report mean and std. 
Present work using ggplot
