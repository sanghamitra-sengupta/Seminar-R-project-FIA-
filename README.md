# Seminar-R-project-FIA
USE THE tree_raw_data_with_env_cleaned.csv
Conduct EDA
Calculate species richness (sr) at grid level #lat long, species name, SR
Calculate the average sr aggregated at the latitudinal band #using x from grid level have LAT BAND, SPECIES, SR. average sr per band
Calculate the moving average at 0.5 degree interval # look at nov 21st code
Estimate the SR using bootstrapping methods (1000 times simulation) and report mean and std. sr. # Select 200 and run 1000 times. Include the tree count column
Present work using ggplot
